With these settings:

<sm-date-time-picker 
  fname="field" 
  label="Date of Birth"
  ng-model="vm.employee.dateOfBirth" 
  flex="50"
  flex-sm="100"
  flex-xs="100"    
  format="DD-MM-YYYY"                      
  is-required="{{true}}" 
  mode="date" 
  week-start-day="Monday">
</sm-date-time-picker>

When I test it like this:
Open date picker -> click on a date (Now time won't appear because of mode) -> select "Cancel"
Result is ---------->>> Wed Oct 03 2018 00:00:00 GMT+0530
Result should be --->>> 04-10-2018 |OR| Blank -> as I have cancelled it.

Is there any option to achieve the desired output on cancel? Please respond as I have tried everything to contact you even the API reference files are blank.

Thank you.
